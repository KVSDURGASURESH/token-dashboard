"""Draft CLAUDE.md-style recommendations, generated from the existing
rule-based Tips engine's findings.

This intentionally reuses tips.py rather than inventing new detection
logic: those findings are already concrete and evidence-based (a file
read N times, a measured cache-hit rate), which is the whole point --
a narrated summary of aggregate scores would just be nicer-sounding
hype around the same thin signal. Never writes to ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
itself -- produces a draft for the user to review and merge manually.
